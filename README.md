### About The Project

This project contains a collection of example IoT devices. Each solution is self-contained and includes its own README, wiring diagram, and a link to the required parts, including a 3D-printable enclosure. Over time, individual devices may receive reviews and new versions aimed at improving real-world, everyday use.

Devices are located in `src` directory. Every individial solution documents:

- A brief list of functional and technical requirements
- Key design decisions, including considered alternatives
- Known limitations and identified problems
- Review - if applicable

In `examples` directory you will find usefull code for various device oriended actions like testing wifi connection / uploading files. Thise part might not be well described.
